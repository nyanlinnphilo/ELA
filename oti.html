            Most of the people do not understand well about the two words that stand as direct opposites, optimism and pessimism. Most writers present their point of view derived from over all generalization that exactness is not included. What will happen if we always cultivate optimism at all times? Similarly, what is going to happen if all of our sensory organs are attached with pessimism? In my opinion, a person who cultivates one of the two will be an extremist never see the truth with correct judgement. Optimism or pessimism can run well only when a person has to meet prosperity or troubles. Optimism is needed to encourage someone who is filled with difficulties, hardships and troubles in his life way. If he embraces pessimism, there is nothing except his failure or giving up his dreams. Each of us has our own ruler to measure the others although their behavior and foundation of mindsets are different. These make them different point of view.

            According to my research, there are many things that cannot give our judgements by holding optimism only. How can we see with optimism upon terrorist attacks of religious extremists? What will the other people tell us if we praise the destructive power of natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, floods, Tsunami waves that destroyed the coasts, severe earthquakes, forest fire that burns large areas, emission of Carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, testing nuclear super power groups, manufacturing and distributing drugs and stimulants, selling humans through human-trafficking, using young children in the attack of suicide bombing, taking parts of the body of the poor people to sell and make money by greedy persons with horrible cruelty, bullying the poor with money and power, people who do not abide by law and commit crimes, drug addition and smugglers who is destroying the state economy?

            Actually, our eyes should see the right thing by possessing differentiating power between good and bad. The good should not be accepted as the bad and the bad should not be thought as the good. Only when we possess the right view when we say the bad thing is bad and the good thing is good. Our world itself inherits us many different situations to cultivate optimism and pessimism. Our life will not be on the right course when we substitute optimism in place of pessimism. By doing so, we will be liars, first by ourselves and then to others. Covering the fault of others is not the work of honest man. Honest men never praise murder case, theft and robbery. Besides, he will not think gambling and drinking into intoxicants as good things. We should be precious persons by expressing the truth. All in all, I would like to end up my view with the most suitable proverb of this topic. That is, it is necessary to lie to others sometimes. But it is always escapable to lie to oneself. We must always remember that.
